## Structure of Genetic Algorithm

```python
# Heuristic 
class GeneticAlgorithm:
    def performEvolution(self, numIterations, numOffstrings):
        # Initial population generation: Requires solution encoding
        population = self.createInitialPopulation()

        # To get solution, how many evolution do you need?
        for i in range(numIterations):
            # Store descendants
            offstring = {}
            for i2 in range(numOffstrings):
                # Selection of two solutions to be used for making a new solution
                p1, p2 = self.selectParents()
                # Creating a new solution from the selected solutions
                offstring[i2] = self.crossoverParents(p1, p2)
                # Introducing some changes in thee new solution
                offstring[i2] = self.mutation(offstring[i2])
        
        # Place the new solutions in the population
        self.substitutePopulation(population, offstring)

        mostFittest = self.findBestSolution(population)

        return mostFittest

# 4. Quick Sort

## Quick Sort

* Basic Idea
  * QuickSort\(Sequence\)
    * Given a sequence
    * Select a **pivot**
      * **Pivot** = a threshold to divide the sequence into two sub-sequences
    * Divide the sequence into two sub-sequences
      * Sequence with values less than the pivot
      * Sequence with values greater than the pivot
    * Return
      * QuickSort\(sequence with less\) + Pivot + QuickSort\(sequence with greater\)
  * By the way, Merge sort forces to divide the sequence in the middle
    * Always the similar sizee of the sub-sequences
  * However, QuickSort depends on which pivot you choose
  * This divides the sequence with the pivot selection

## Importance of Pivot in Quick Sort

* What-if the pivot is biased
  * Let's assume that
    * Pivot is always the smallest number
    * Then?
      * Just another selection sort
  * Same to the O\(NÂ²\) sorting algorithms
  * Hence the pivot selection is important
  * Pivot selection approach
    * Median
    * Random
* Particullay, Merge sort is more preferable because?
  * Doesn't have to worry about the pivot selection

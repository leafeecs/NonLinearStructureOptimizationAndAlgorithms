# 3. Heap Sort

## Heap Sort

* Priority Queue
  * Repeated, dequeue with the highest priority
  * = dequeue the maximum value
  * Well-utilizable for sorting
  * Particularly,
    * Binary heap enables the dequeuing with O\(logN\)
      * Because it is a binary search tree
    * For dequeuing all elements, it takes O\(NlogN\)
      * Same to the sorting all of the elements
* How to perform a sorting with a heap \(= heap sort\)
  * Given a list whose index ranges from 0 to N
  * Firstly, build the binary heap through insertions = O\(NlogN\)
    * N items to insert
    * Percolation takes maximum logN
      * Is it true? Any better way?
        * Actually, there is a better way. It only takes O\(N\), but in this course, we will not cover it
  * Secondly, take out one element at a time = O\(NlogN\)
    * For itr in range\(0, N\):
      * Sorted\[itr\] = Heap.getHighestPriority\( \)
  * Therefore, O\(NlogN\) + O\(NlogN\) = O\(2NlogN\) â†’ O\(NlogN\)

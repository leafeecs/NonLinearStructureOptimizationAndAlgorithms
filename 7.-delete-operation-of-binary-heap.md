# 7. Delete Operation of Binary Heap

## Delete Operation of Binary Heap

* Delete of binary heap, a.k.a. Percolate-down or Cascade-down
  * Starting from a root
  * Approaching toward a leaf
  * How to?
    * Delete the root node value by replacing the node with the last node
    * Compare the value to the value of the inserted node's children
    * If the children's value is bigger than the parent's, \(pick a bigger child\)
      * The heap property is broken
      * Exchange the root value and the bigger value from children
      * Repeat this comparison at the exchange child's node

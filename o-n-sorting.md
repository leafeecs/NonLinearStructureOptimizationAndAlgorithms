# O\(N\) Sorting

## O\(N\) Sorting

* Sorting Algorithm
  * Average case O\(N\) sorting
  * **Not comparison-based** approach
    * The best performance of the comparison based approach is O\(NlogN\)
    * Therefore, should not be based upon comparisons
  * Rather based upon counting and numeric properties
  * Variants
    * Counting Sort
    * Radix Sort
  * Pros and Cons?
    * Cons: assumptions and not comparison-based
    * Pros: best time complexity
      * Because O\(N\) is best time complexity

## Counting Sort

* Assumption
  * The sequence contains integers ranging from 0 to K
* **Count the occurrence** and produce a sequence based upon the counts
* Basic idea
  * For itr from 0 to N
    * Value = sequence\[itr\]
    * Count\[value\] = Count\[value\] + 1
  * For itr1 from 0 to K
    * For itr2 from 0 to Count\[itr1\]
      * Print itr1
  * Therefore, O\(N\) + O\(N\) = O\(2N\) â†’ O\(N\)
* Time Complexity
  * O\(N + R\)
  * R = the range of the sequence values
    * R = ranging from 0 to K
    * In some case, if R is very big
  * N = the size of the sequence
